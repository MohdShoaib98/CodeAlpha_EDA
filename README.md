# CodeAlpha_EDA
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Electric Vehicle Population dataset using Python. I examined the data structure, identified trends, patterns, and anomalies, tested hypotheses, and found data quality issues. I created a detailed multi-sheet Excel report.

# CodeAlpha Internship, Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for Task 2, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), for the CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship. The aim of this task is to carry out a thorough EDA on a dataset. I will ask meaningful questions, identify trends and anomalies, test hypotheses, and find data quality issues.

For this project, I used the Electric Vehicle Population Data, which I converted to Excel format. This dataset has a variety of categorical and numerical fields, making it suitable for uncovering insights.

## Objectives
This project meets the Task 2 requirements:

1. Ask meaningful questions before analysis:
   - Which vehicle make is most common?
   - What is the most popular electric vehicle type?
   - Which county has the highest EV count?
   - What is the distribution of electric range?
   - Are there missing or duplicate records?

2. Explore the data structure, including variables, data types, and dimensions.

3. Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies, such as top values, frequency counts, and unusual data points.

4. Test hypotheses and validate assumptions using summary statistics and outlier detection.

5. Detect potential data issues, like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
